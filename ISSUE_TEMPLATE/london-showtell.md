Agenda:

• Welcome & networking
• News and Announcements
• Show and Tell!

This month we're hosting a Show and Tell meetup, what this means is that you should have a demo you can show us. We'll accept even a hello world demo in http://play.rust-lang.org or a running version of servo. Anything is permissible so long as it's Rust related.

Your demo doesn't have to last very long (but let me know if it's longer than 10 minutes so I can scheduled around the shorter ones).

If it's a project, it doesn't even need to be a fully working prototype.

We're at Skillsmatter, so please remember to fill out their attendance link: __LINK__
